# House Price Predictor

Welcome to the House Price Predictor project!  
This repository contains code and resources for predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques, as part of a Kaggle competition.

## Overview

The project leverages a variety of machine learning models—including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost—to accurately estimate house prices based on a rich set of features. Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation are all included in the workflow.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing with automated handling of missing values
- Feature selection and encoding for optimal model performance
- Multiple regression models with hyperparameter tuning
- Ensemble methods for improved prediction accuracy
- Visualization of results and model diagnostics

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`).
3. Follow the Jupyter notebooks for data preparation and model training.

## Project Structure
